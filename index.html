				<div id="paragraphtext">Over the course of 10 days, I had collected data on my food for delivery orders. As I make my orders through a single platform, I was able to go back and collect data on which meals I had ordered, their cuisines, and the date and time the orders were placed. I also collected additional data on the nutritional value and macro composition of the different meals in an attempt to analogise the three factors of price, nutrition and schedule. Visualisiing the data in this way with date and time being the common denominator helped reveal trends in a handful of New York cuisines and their respective nutritional value for money, or alternatively, whether they were overcharging or undercharging for the nutrition they were providing. This also helped me in understanding my spending patterns with food across a 10 day period over the weekdays and weekends and has given me insight into the thresholds that would allow me to change my behaviour.
